# Resources
You can find code, data files, and other relevant resources I use in my teaching/research here.

The folders are organized according to the context in which the resources are used (e.g. a book, publication, or course I teach)

All comments are welcome. Feel free to contact me at dennis.tay@gmail.com / dennis.tay@polyu.edu.hk
