# Resources
You can find code, data files, and other relevant resources I use in my teaching/research here.

The folders are organized according to the context in which the resources are used. For example, a book, other publication, or teaching. For example, the folder 
'Teaching datasets' contains toy datasets for practice in my Python courses.
