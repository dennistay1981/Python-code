I think I will struggle a lot in the beginning.,I can search on Youtube to look for tutorials.,If I cannot pick up in the beginning then it may be troubling to learn something more difficult as weeks go by.,I face more opportunities when learning because I can ask for teacher's and classmates advice and there are a lot of information on youtube.
